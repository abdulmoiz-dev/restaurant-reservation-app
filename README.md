# Restaurant Table Reservation App

This is a full-stack restaurant table reservation application designed to allow customers to reserve tables online. Admins can manage restaurant menus, reservations, and customer details through their accounts.

## Project Structure
This app is built as a **monorepo** with the following structure:

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** (for web) and **React Native** (for mobile).
- **Backend**: Powered by **Next.js** API routes for backend services.
  
## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Used for building the web application interface.
- **React Native**: Used for building the mobile app interface for iOS and Android.

### Backend
- **Next.js**: Utilized for the backend API routes, handling server-side functions, and managing RESTful APIs.

### Database
- **Database System**: Can be integrated with databases such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** (or any other SQL database).
  
## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** and **npm** or **yarn**

```
This will start the web application on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 2. Start the Mobile Application (React Native)
To run the mobile app, make sure an Android/iOS emulator is running or a device is connected:
```bash
cd mobile
npx react-native run-android  # For Android
npx react-native run-ios      # For iOS
```

#### 3. Start the Backend Server (Next.js)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.
